Particle Filter Pipeline

1. Initialization
   - Pick number of particles for the overall monte carlo method
   - Create each particle and set its x, y, theta (heading) to values normally
     distributed around initial position estimate from GPS
   - Also initialize each particle's initial weight to 1

2. Prediction
   - For each particle, estimate its new position and heading (x, y, theta) based
     on CONTROL inputs (velocity, yaw_rate - i.e, gas, steering) using derived equations.

3. Update
   - For each particle, update its position based on observed landmark measurements (using LIDAR and RADAR data)
     - Assume that the LIDAR point cloud has been clustered into actual landmark positions in car coordinates
     - We will get a lot of such clustered points and we need to figure out which ones correspond to actual map landmarks
       - We do this by first translating the observed landmarks into map coordinates
       	 - https://discussions.udacity.com/t/coordinate-transform/241288/27
	 - Use a rotation matrix to derive the offset and then add the offset to the measured position to get the map coordinates position
       - Then we pick the observed points closest (in euclidian distance) to each map landmark to represent the measured landmark position
     *** NOTE: Instead of the using the observed landmark measurements to update or compute the "vehicle's" x,y,theta,
       we update the weight of each particle instead using the multivariate gaussian equation that uses multivariate gaussian probability
       density function (pdf). This weight update function uses the predicted and observed landmark positions (specified in just x and y -
       note theta (heading) isn't needed in the update step, it is only used during prediction)

4. Resample particles using the resampling wheel

   - We're recomputing/repopulating the ParticleFilter::particles with a new set of particles
